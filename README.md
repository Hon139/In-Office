# Inspiration
Working remotely can often be isolating. You don't see your coworkers or your boss and you don't know what they're doing. Existing applications do not list out members in ways that naturally fit into human perception. Just imagine any group of people - are they lined up similar to the profiles on the side of a messaging app? No! The existing applications have that clear disadvantage to virtual environments. We thought that mimicking the environment of the office virtually would bring the experience of working in an office at home.

# ✨ Features

📞 One-click video calling between coworkers — no meeting links, just connect.

🧑‍💻 Presence awareness — see who's online and available.

🎨 Charming pixel art widgets for an engaging, gamified experience.

💬 Live socket-based updates for real-time interactivity.

🌐 Web-based and lightweight — no installations needed.

# 🖥️ Tech Stack
MelonJS, Vite, Express, Sockets.io, ElevenLabs, Jitsi.

# What's next?
This application is limited in the sense that the amount of rooms is about equal to a department. We want to make it possible to walk to different departments represented in different screens, and to feel the character of the department in the visuals by customizing.
